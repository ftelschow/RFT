Description: This package implements basic tools from Random Field Theory (RFT).
    The key unknown quantities in RFT are the Lipshitz-Killing curvatures of a
    random field. Their knowledge allows to compute the expected Euler
    characteristic (EEC) of the excursion set of the field above a threshold.
    This package implements different estimators of the LKCs which can be found
    in the literature and provides basic functions to obtain the EEC curves for
    several Gaussian realated fields such as for example fields having
    marginally a normal, Student's, t, chi^2 or F distribution.
    It also contains functions to compute quickly the Euler characteristic of
    excursion sets of a function over an arbitrary domain in dimension up to 3.
